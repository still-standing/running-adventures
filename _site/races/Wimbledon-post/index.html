			</p>
			

			<h2 id="the-race-mood">The race mood</h2>

<p>I got in the <strong>race mood</strong> even before arriving to the starting line of the race. My mood actually started 
to change when, along the trip to Wimbledon, I clearly recognized other runners, listening to music, reading a book, chatting with 
someone else. How did I do to recognize them? It was actually easy, they were all tensed, focused, and it was
 clearly way to early to be in running clothes on Sunday morning! And then… Well, I was already up and dressed in running clothes 
 so I just needed to be tensed and focused too, to fit the crowd. Not easy to do, trust me.</p>

<h2 id="the-goal-race-time">The goal race time</h2>

<p>Once in the <strong>race mood</strong>, the only think I was able to think was my goal time. I wanted to do less than 1h50. 
But <strong>Bergamotte</strong> spent days to convince me that I should run my first half marathon below 1h45.</p>

<p><strong>Bergamotte</strong> was saying that is obvious:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Since I was running at least a half-marathon every Sunday in less than 2h, it would be <strong>easy</strong>.</li>
  <li>Since I managed to run a half-marathon in 1h46 three weeks before this race, it would be <strong>easy peasy</strong>.</li>
  <li>Since it is of common knowledge that one runs much faster during a race, it would be <strong>easy peasy lemon squeezy</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-race">The race</h2>

<p>Okay Bergamotte! Let’s do it!!!</p>

<p>I started strong, a little bit too exited maybe. Following the crowd, I was able to get a 5k Personal Record (PR) and a 10k PR in the first half of the race.
The problem was that I needed to continue for the other half… 
By keeping this pace I would have finished around 1h42!!! But I did not… And I also stopped to follow the crowd… 
This is where I started to feel panic shortly followed by a clear lack of coordination.</p>

<p>Few comments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A 5k PR and a 10k PR in a 21km race does not seem right.</li>
  <li>I hear from time to time that the first 2/3 of the race should be run with your legs and the last third with your heart. Few notes about that:
    <ul>
      <li>It clearly does not work for the last 10k of a half marathon.</li>
      <li>The heart is indeed not enough to “run” about 10k on its own.</li>
      <li>It actually only works for 5k races (I checked).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
