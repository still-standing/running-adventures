### the race mood

I got in the **race mood** even before arriving to the starting line of the race. My mood actually started 
to change when, along the trip to Wimbledon, I clearly recognized other runners, listening to music, reading a book, chatting with 
someone else. How did I do to recognize them? It was actually easy, they were all tensed, focused, and it was way to early to be in running clothes on Sunday morning! And then… Well, I was already up and dressed in running clothes so I just needed to be tensed and focused too, to fit the crowd. Not easy to do, trust me.
 
### the race goal time

<p>Once in the **race mood**, the only think I was able to think was my goal time. I wanted to do less than 1h50. 
But <strong>Bergamotte</strong> spent days to convince me that I should run my first half marathon below 1h45.

**Bergamotte** was saying that is obvious:

* Since I was running at least a half-marathon every Sunday in less than 2h, it would be **easy**
* Since I managed to run a half-marathon in 1h46 three weeks before this race, it would be **easy peasy**
* Since it is of common knowledge that one runs much faster during a race, it would be **easy peasy lemon squeezy**
</ul>

### the race

Okay **Bergamotte**! Let’s do it

I started strong, a little bit too exited maybe. Following the crowd, I was able to get a 5km Personal Record (PR) and a 10km PR in the first half of the race.
The problem was second half… 
By keeping this pace I would have finished around 1h42!!! But I did not… And I also stopped to follow the crowd… 
This is where I started to feel panic shortly followed by a clear lack of coordination.

### Few comments:
* A 5k PR and a 10k PR in a 21km race does not seem right, and I am pretty sure now that it is not okay!</li>
* I heard that the first 2/3 of the race should be run with your legs and the last third with your heart. Few notes about that:
	* It clearly does not work for the last 10k of a half marathon.</li>
	* The heart is indeed not enough to “run” about 10k on its own.</li>
	* It actually only works for 5k races (I checked).</li>
