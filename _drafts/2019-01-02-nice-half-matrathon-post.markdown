## The race goal time

This time I will get below 1h45! I did not manage to do it at Wimbledon Common, but 

   1. I was sick...
   2. I started too fast...
   3. I song in my playlist made me cried...

As a matter of fact, all those points can be easily resolved:

   1. Do not get sick!
   2. Do not start too strong!
   3. Remove from my playlist!

The good news was that I was fully recovered from the flu, and it will be not too difficult 
to start the race at a slower pace! 1. and 2. solved! 

The last item to work on was the playlist and 
it appeared to be a little bit more complicated than expected...

## The last run before the race
Since the race was on Sunday, I decided to only go for a little run, on Wednesday.
To achieve my race goal time, I should hold a pace a little bit below 5min/km (8min/mile), 
so I chose to go for an easy 6min/km pace. And it was just fine.
It was just fine until I started to fell a little bit of pain in my right thigh...
A little bit pain, but then, a lot of pain... Damn!
<br> I finished the run walking, and even that was not pleasant... 
<br> You may ask, so what now? Well, good question. The plan is easy:
 to rest and to be fully recovered tomorrow!   

## The party
The day after, the pain was still there and I naturally decided to extent my race goal time 
by quite a lot, from 1h45 to 2h. Yeah, it was that bad, I was walking like a duck... 
And ducks are not know for there running capabilities.

The good news was it was the day after Wednesday, namely Thirsty Thursday!

#### The unique glass of red wine

The plan was simple, to go to a pub with some friends from work, have fun, drink a glass of wine, 
and go home, early. 

#### The unique bottle of wine
But soon after asking for a glass of wine, the bartender convince us that, 
it is better to order directly a bottle
It was happy hour, and well, maybe two glasses is still okay...
