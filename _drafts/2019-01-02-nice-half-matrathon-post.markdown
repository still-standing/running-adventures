## The race goal time

This time I will get below 1h45! I did not manage to do it at Wimbledon Common, but 

   1. I was sick...
   2. I started too fast...
   3. I song in my playlist made me cried...

As a matter of fact, all those points can be easily resolved:

   1. Do not get sick!
   2. Do not start too strong!
   3. Remove from my playlist!

The good news was that I was fully recovered from the flu, and it will be not too difficult 
to start the race at a slower pace! 1. and 2. solved! 

The last item to work on was the playlist and it appeared to be a little bit more complicated...
