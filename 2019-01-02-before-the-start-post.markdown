title: "Before The Start a.k.a. The Bear Beginning"
---


As mentioned in a previous post, I have begun to run before the Killer BaBa night. 

My first months of running could actually be resumed by a simple analogy: It is like **making love to a bear**... (of course, figuratively speaking). 

Figuratively speaking, yes. But the side effects look pretty similar:

* DIZZINESS, it is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is dizziness. Please, it is serious... Just think about it a little longer! Now, it is pretty obvious right? 	
	* Well, if you do not breath enough while running... You will get really dizzy! Not a pleasant sensation...

* DEHYDRATION, it is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is dehydration. Just think about it for a second...  Please, it is serious... Just think about it a little longer! Now, it is pretty obvious right? 
	* Well, if you do not drink enough before the run, during the run, or after the run... You will get really dehydated! Not a pleasant sensation...

* PAIN LOCALIZED IN THE LOWER BODY PARTS, it is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is pain localized in the lower body parts. Please, it is serious... Just think about it a little longer! Now, it is pretty obvious right? 
	*  Well, while starting running, you will solicitate in a not so gentle way muscles, tendons, and ligaments localized in the lower part of your body... And they will let you know that they do not like it at all! Not a pleasant sensation...

* SCARS, it is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is getting scars. Please, it is serious... Just think about it a little longer! Now, it is pretty obvious right? 
	*  Well, if you do not lift your feet high enough you will trip, fall down, and smash the ground! Not a pleasant sensation...   

I know that you all now expect from me to describe the good parts of **making love to a bear**... Unfortunately, it is time to stop the analogy. For obvious reasons...

Runnning was just fun enough to continue to do it ;-)


### Comments

* I actually heard the **bear expression** quite recently in a business related discussion... Maybe you wonder now what type of job I am doing... Good question! 


* This post will now be refered to as the **bear beginning**.
