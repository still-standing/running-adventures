After writing the [Killer BaBa Night]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-the-start-post %}) post, 
I naturally decided to send it to the dream team to get their feedback.

### The feedback

I have to be honest, I did not collect the feedback of all members of the dream team...
 When I called **Barby Girl**, we did not speak much, 
 she was warming up for a rugby match and about to practice the scrum...
But this is classic **Barby Girl**!

While **Gummy Bear**, **Chamomile**, and **Rambo Chérie** were kind of indifferent 
about the post, **Aurélia** reacted completely differently. She bloody loved it!
She was not able to stop complimenting the concept of the blog in general and the choice of her alias in particular, 
up to the point where it even became embarrassing... But this is classic **Aurélia**! 

The only teeny-tiny suggestion was to make the website title a teeny-tiny more comprehensive for the reader.

### The title

Point taken. I have to agree with **Aurélia**, **The Running Adventures of the Still Standing Muffin Man** is,
 at first sight, pretty cryptic. Cryptic enough to try to bring a little bit of clarity...
 
#### Bringing confusion

Let's first analyze where the confusion is by splitting the title in four parts: 
the **Running Adventures**, the **Still Standing**, the **Muffin**, and the **Man**:
 
1. the **Running Adventures**
    
   Since it is a blog dedicated to long distance running, starting with **The Running** makes at least sense. 
   But is it really an **adventure**? And even worse, **adventures** in plural? 
   
   Confusing the reader...
    
2. the **Still Standing**
    
   If the website is all about running, why then mentioning **still** or **standing**?
   It simply defeats the purpose of running... 
   
   Confusing further the reader...


3. the **Muffin**
    
   Does the writer like pastries in general and muffin in particular? 
    Does the website is about gluten free vegan muffin recipes to enhance the long distance running performance? 
    
    Confusing even further the reader...

4. the **Man**

   As mentioned in the [Killer BaBa Night]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-the-start-post %}), 
   post we are now in the **Post Gender Theory Area**. It is then not possible to determine 
    the biological gender nor the emotional gender. 
    
    Overloading the reader of confusion...

 
#### Bringing clarity
Let's now answer those questions! 

1. the **Running Adventures**

Being an emotional kind of guy, all my runs feels like the very first run of Forrest Gum:

  And each one of my runs looks to me like an adventures.

2. the **Still Standing**

After a run, **Barely Standing** would be more appropriate but **Still Standing** is more cool!
And more importantly, **Still Standing** appears in the lyrics of one of mine post-running favourite songs:

  Don't get me wrong, feeling "looking like a true survivor" after a run is definitely a teeny-tiny exaggerated.
But, "feeling like a little kid" is spot on ;-)

3. the **Muffin** and the **Man**

This is a little dedication to the animated movie Shrek in general, and 
a really short scene in particular:

  <iframe width="240" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3taMwAEGBVc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  This scene made me laughed so much, 
and so hard, that it got stick in my head. Since then, I was looking
for an opportunity to place "the Muffin Man" somewhere...

  I have to admit that using "the Muffin Man" in a website dedicated to
running is a bit of stretch, but it is good enough for me. And I hope it
is good enough for you too ;-)


### Conclusion
The title should by now be chrystal clean... (of course, figuratively speaking).
