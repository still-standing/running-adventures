After writing the [Killer BaBa Night]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-the-start-post %}) post, 
I naturally decided to send it to the dream team to get their feedback about their aliases and the post itself.

### The aliases

I have to be honest, I did not collect the feedback of all the dream team...
 When I called **Little Tabitha**, we did not speak much, she was warming up for a rugby match and about to practice the scrum...

While **Bergamote**, **Chamomile**, and **Rambo Chérie** were kind of indifferent 
about the aliases and the post, **Aurélia** reacted completely differently. She bloody loved it!
She was not able to stop complimenting the concept of the blog in general and the choice of her alias in particular, up to the point 
where it even became embarrassing... But this is classic **Aurélia**! 

The only teeny-tiny suggestion was to make the website title a teeny-tiny more comprehensive for the reader.

### The title

Point taken. I have to agree with **Aurélia**, **The Running Adventures of the Still Standing Muffin Man** is,
 at first sight, pretty cryptic. Cryptic enough to motivate the writer to bring a little bit of clarity.
 
#### Bringing confusion

Let's first analyze where the confusion is by splitting the title in four parts: 
the **Running Adventures**, the **Still Standing**, the **Muffin**, and the **Man**:
 
1. the **Running Adventures**
    
   Since it is a blog dedicated to long distance running, starting with **The Running** makes at least sense. 
   But is it really an **adventure**? And even worse, **adventures** in plural? 
   
   Confusing the reader...
    
2. the **Still Standing**
    
   If the website is about running, then why mentioning **still** or **standing**?
   It simply defeats the purpose of running... 
   
   Confusing further the reader...


3. the **Muffin**
    
   Does the writer like pastries in general and muffin in particular? 
    Does the website is about gluten free vegan muffin recipes to enhance the long distance running performance? 
    Or, in other words, did the writer discover the secret of a healthy gluten free vegan HPO-like product?
    
    Confusing even further the reader...

4. the **Man**

   As mentioned in the [Killer BaBa Night]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-the-start-post %}), post we are now in the **Post Gender Theory Area**. It is then not possible to determine 
    the biological gender nor the emotional gender. 
    
    Overloading the reader of confusion...

 
#### Bringing clarity
Let's now answer those questions! Actually, you just have to watch these three very short videos,
 smash them together and everything will become crystal clear...
