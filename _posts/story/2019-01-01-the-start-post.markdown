### the decor 


The moment everything really started was in Summer 2018 during a dinner at the terrace of a restaurant in 
Nice - South of France at the terrace of a restaurant in the *Vieux Nice*; with few friends, 
a lot of good food, a lot of good wine, and a lot of bad cigarettes (but please, do not drink nor smoke...). 

We were finishing our glasses of wine while waiting for the dessert. The dessert will reveal to be a huge 
[rum baba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_baba), with more rum than baba, and which will kill us all later (figuratively speaking...).

### an innocent phrase

Waiting for the soon to be killer Baba, I told the table: 

"By the way guys, '**Mademoiselle-Docteur-Chérie-mon-Amour-ma-Femme-de-ma-Vie-mon-Épouse**' and I started to run a bit...".

'**Tabatha**' immediately jumped on me (figuratively speaking...):

- "Next May there is the half-marathon of Nice! I will register! You want to register? Better if I register you! Wait we cannot register now... But as soon that we can we register! Deal?"

Rare are the moments where I do not want to speak, this moment was one of those... Having nothing to say, I decided to light a cigarette and wait for the storm to pass... But it did not. 

### the storm

Between my first and second drag I discovered that:

* '**[Bergamotte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamot_orange)**' already run the half of Nice under 1h45!

* '**[Camomille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamomile)**' already run a  half of Nice under 1h35, three marathons and 4h, and will run the Toulouse marathon in a couple of months!

* '**[Tabatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabatha_Cash)**' run few halves and marathons every year quote "for fun" unquote.

* '**[Aurelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelia_Cotta)**' is running the marathon under 3h quote "easy" unquote!

### the trap 

OK guys, few comments:

* First, we all need to calm down.

* Second, we should clearly speak a little bit more because I had no clue you were doing all that shit...

* Third, okay guys... Challenge accepted! 

With so much peer pressure, I just had no escape...

After that, the killer Baba arrived, and the rest is fun blurry history.


### Comments

* To respect the privacy and integrity of the people involved in those running adventures, aliases will be used.
   * Since we are now in a Post Gender Theory area, the biological gender cannot be deduced from the alias.
	* The aliases are somehow chosen completely at random... Or are they?
  
* To shorten the alias '**Mademoiselle-Docteur-Chérie-mon-Amour-ma-Femme-de-ma-Vie-mon-Épouse**', the alias will be replaced by '**[Rambo Chérie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rambo)**'. 

* This evening will be referred as the **Killer BaBa Night**.

* Sad sad news, the restaurant removed the rum bab from its menu... Customers were complaining about the rum bab side effects such as liver failure and cirrhosis.
