**Bergamotte** was all excited to tell to the gang that after few weeks of rest he was able to run a small 7k at an easy pace!

That news was really surprising, running an easy run was not **Bergamotte** style.

No.

**Bergamotte** runs a 10k all-out and take at least a week to recover for the next run. This is the **Bergamotte** style.

So what happened?

He just decided to change of running form, form heel-strike to front-foot.




   
 The adverb *only* can seem of a weird use here, 

 


Having a correct running form is not easy, all the body should actually be engaged to do one thingr; run as fast as possible for a given distance. as economical as possible:

* arm movement to avoid body rotation
* number of strike per minute to be around 180


... and smash them all together!

If you smash them in this very specific order, everything will be by now completely clear (of course, figuratively speaking).
