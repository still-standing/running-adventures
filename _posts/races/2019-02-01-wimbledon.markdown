### From Nice to Wimbledon

Since we all signed up for the [UTMC half-marathon](https://www.utmc.fr), the Dream Team kind of reached an unsaid agreement:
<br> The Nice half-marathon, in May the 5th, was a little bit too close from the UTMC, in July the 21st, 
 let's just skip it. 
<br> But I did not want the crazy UTMC trail to be my first race either... 
So, I found another half-marathon, in April the 7th, in Wimbledon Common. 
<br> That was just perfect! Perfect in theory... In practice, it was something else...

### The Dream Team

In theory, all the members of the Dream Team would have joined...
<br> But in practice, I was the only one...
<br> And I am pretty sure it would have been much funnier!
 
### The playlist
I have loaded my iPod with hundreds of my favorite songs! 
<br> And, since I am a rock'n'roll kind of guy, the songs will, in theory, help me to run fast enough!

### The physical condition
In theory, you are at your pick physical level to race...
<br> But in practice, I managed to catch a cold few days before the race... 
<br> But it was not that dramatic, I was just full of medicine!

### The race time goal

In theory, you manage to race under your race time goal...
<br> I had initially a pretty conservative race goal time of 1h50. 
<br> But **Bergamot** spent days to convince me that 
I should run my first half marathon below 1h45.

**Bergamot** was actually stating the obvious:

* Since I was running at least a half-marathon every Sunday in less than 1h50, it would be **easy**. Well... make sense, right?
* Since I managed to run a half-marathon in 1h46 three weeks before this race, it would be **easy peasy**. Well... make sense, right?
* Since you race faster than you run, it would be **easy peasy lemon squeezy**. Well... make sense, right?

### The race

Okay **Bergamot**! Let’s do it!

I started strong, a little bit too exited maybe... Following the crowd, I was able to get a 5km Personal Record (PR) and a 10km PR in the first half of the race.
The main problem I then faced was to continue at that pace for the second half… 
By keeping this pace I would have finished around 1h40, pretty cool no?! 

#### When a very specific song kicked in

But then… My iPod decided to play *Ain't no sunshine* by *Bill Withers*. 
Don't get me wrong, I love this song, it is a great song, a song full of emotions...

<br>

<br> ... maybe full of too many emotions!
<br> I was thinking about **Mademoiselle-Docteur-Chérie-mon-Amour-ma-Femme-de-ma-Vie-mon-Épouse** a.k.a. **Rambo Chérie**, not there with me... And I just started to cry, and stopped to run. 
Looks like I am an emotional kind of guy after all. 
<br> Yeah, I stopped to run because of this song... And also because I was not able to breath neither... 
Let's say a little bit of both.
And once you stop to run, you will continue to stop...

I finally crossed the finished line with a race time of 1h48. 

But I learned few valuable lessons:

   * do not have *Ain't no sunshine* in your playlist.
   * do not start the race too strong:

       * A 5k PR and a 10k PR in a 21km race does not seem right, and I am pretty sure that it is not!
       * I heard that the first 2/3 of the race should be run with your legs and the last third with your heart. Well, it clearly does not work for the last 10k of a half marathon.

### Conclusion

Yes, I was sick.
<br> Yes, I cried.
<br> Yes, I did not get a Personal Record on the half-marathon distance.
<br> But it was so fun! And I am already thinking about the next race...

### The next race

I realized few days later that the unsaid agreement evoked earlier was void:

* **Rambo Chérie** really wanted to race the Nice half-marathon. 
* **Barbie Girl** already registered to the Nice half-marathon.
* **Chamomile** will join the race even if he is playing hard to get for now.

Okay guys! let's just do it then!!!


Only **Aurélia** and **Bergamot** will not be able to join, but more on that later...
