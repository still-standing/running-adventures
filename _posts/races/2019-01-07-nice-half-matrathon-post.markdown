After the [Wimbledon Common half-marathon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-06-wimbledon-half-marathon-post %}) on April the 7th, I wanted to focus on the <a href="https://www.utmc.fr" target="_blank">UTMC half-marathon</a>... But, again, I had no escape and I raced the Nice half-marathon on May the 5th. 

## The race goal time Tuesday
Six days before the race I was able to get an estimate of my race goal time. It was actually easy, I did not manage to go under 1h45 (4:55min/km or 8min/mile) at Wimbledon Common, but, in Nice, I will! 
Let me remind you that for the Wimbledon Common race:

   1. I was sick...
   2. I started too fast...
   3. I cried...

As a matter of fact, all those points can be easily resolved:

   1. Do not get sick!
   2. Do not start too strong!
   3. Do not cry!

Easy, isin't it?... But, as nothing goes usually according to plan, I realized that another important item should be added:

   4. Do not get injured!

## Easy Run Wednesday
Since the race was on Sunday, I decided to only go for a little run on Wednesday (6min/km pace). And it was just fine, it was just fine until I started to fell a little bit of pain in my right thigh...
A little bit pain, and a little bit more, and a little more, and then a lot of pain... 
<br> I finished the "run" walking, and even the walk was painful... !?&∞&¡¿. 
<br> So what to do? Well, not much, simply resting and hoping that tomorrow it will become good again!   

## Thirsty Thursday
The day after, it was far from good... It was actually bad. The pain was still there and I had not choice but to extent my race goal time... From 1h45 to 2h... It was that bad... I was walking like a duck...  And ducks are not known for there running capabilities. 

But life should go on, and since I flushed my race goal time to the toilet, I decided to join the usual Thirsty Thursday party. 

The plan was simple, to go to the <a href="https://www.jerusalembarandkitchen.com/" target="_blank">Jerusalem bar</a> with some good friends from work, have fun, drink a unique glass of wine, and go home, early. Injured or not, I was still racing on Sunday!

But, somehow, the unique glass of wine became the unique bottle of wine... But let me reassure you, I was not drinking the bottle alone, **Jordy** was helping me! Then, the unique bottle of wine became somehow three botttes of wine, coupled with few tequilla shots, and one bad cigarette... And after a lot of cheers (obviously), a lot of dancing, and a lot of fun, I managed to go home at 1am. Pretty early right?... Well, what can I say, I really enjoyed the party... 

## Hungover Friday

The next day went as you would expect, I was still injured and, on top of that, I had a teeny-tiny hangover... But totally worth it! 
I used this day to finetune the race playlist by removing all the emotional songs that could make me cry! And, trust me on that, I did a pretty good job!

## Trip to Nice Saturday
Finally back to the race mood, **Rambo Chérie** and I arrived in Nice around 5pm. Yes guys, **Rambo Chérie** was racing the half too! 
We landed to Nice around 5pm, went directly to collect our race numbers, and joined the Dream Team in the Vieux Nice. But, this time, we skipped the [rum baba]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-the-start-post %})...
They were all good! Except **Aurélia** and **Bergamot**, they both got injured and dedided to skip the race.  

How **Aurélia** injured her adductor muscle remains a mystery... The most likely hypothesis are:

* doing the splits without warm up.
* going for long horse ride. 
* doing the splits without warm up while riding a horse.

But nobody really knows, or dares to ask. Even if **Aurélia** is pure kindness, no one wants to push it...

On his side, **Bergamot** managed to get injured by simply getting out of bed without streching... Yep. **Bergamot** is kind of stiff...

So, a reduced Dream Team, composed of **Barbie Girl**, Chamomile, **Rambo Chérie**, and I, will be racing tomorrow!

## The concert Saturday

The evening before the race day you just want to eat and go to sleep as fast as possible... not even drinking a unique glass of wine! But **Aurélia**'s band was performing tonight in a bar... So we all went... We all enjoyed the concert! And we all drank a unique glass of wine and some smoked a unique cigarette... 

Not the ideal day before the race type of night... But totally worth it!

Ranbo Chérie, Camomille and I finally arrived at **Bergamot**'s place around midnight, and started to swear in a multitude of different languages when we set up the alarm at 5:30am... 

## Race Sunday

#### The morning coffee
After smashing my phone on the wall to stop the alarm 5:30 alarm, I went to the kitchen for a well needed coffee. But Chamomile was already in there preparing the coffee. I was about to start the usual morning conversion when I looked through the window, and started to contemplate a violent pourdown... Chamomile and I ended up in front of the window holding a coffee, admiring the huge drops of rain falling down, and, between two sips one of us would say: 
- "That's bad...", 
- "That's just bad", 
- "That's really bad", 
- "That's so bad", 
- "That's so so bad",

And we could have continued... But **Rambo Chérie** arrived looked at the window, look at us, look at the window again, and simply said, very accurately:

-  !?&∞&¡¿ 

Shoking, for sure, but **Rambo Chérie** was so right! 

Even if Chamomile was a little bit shaky after hearing what he heard, we all managed to get race ready and left the flat with **Bergamot**te still sleeping in there.
Along the way to the start line, the rain stopped! That was finally a good news! 
We arrived at the start line at around 7:30am and, after a quick warm up, I decided to change again my goal race time: even if I was still feeling my tight pretty well, it did not not matter, I will al least try to go under 1h45! Hell yeah! Chamonile also targeted 1h45 and suggested we run together. This was an offer that cannot be refused!

#### The car

At 7:55am, all the runners discovered that the start time will be postponed. A very nice guy, or better said !?&∞&¡¿, decided to park his car on the race route... The police had to do all the required security checks and remove the car... 

#### The race
At 8:30, we finally go! Let's just do it!!! 

I switched on my iPod with my finetuned playlist, composed on only one song: Waterloo from ABBA.

</center>
What can I say... It looks like I am very emotional!  I may have, indeed, overdone the finetuning, but I was confident enough that I will not cry!

Following the crowd, Chamomile and I started the race slow at around 6min/km. I was happy about that pace but Chamomile started to accelerate to get to the 1h45 flag. !?&∞&¡¿, but I followed. We spent the first 5km slaloming between runners to reach the holly flag. Now we just have to stick with him up to the finish line! At that time I alreasy knew by eart the lyrics of the ABBA song, the rest of race will be long... 

Racing with Chamomile was fun! He was speaking all the time! I was not really listening, but I was with him and I was feeling good. After the first 11k, I did not cry nor stop running! My tight was kind of okay, and we decided to pass the flag to gain few extra minutes. 

Finally, the last 5km, this is when things started to be really tough. I wanted to stop and through away the iPod with this bloody ABBA song. But Chamonile motivated me to keep going. 
"Come on! We will cross the finish line together! Let's do it!"
And, with the support of Chamonile, and a lot of swearing from my side, we finally crossed the finish line together: 


To celebrate we just huged each other and I finally switched off my iPod. 

#### The logs

#### The medals
After few minutes of rest, it was time to collect the medals. One of the guys in charge of the medal distribution was free and we went for him. We looked like a serious man in his 50s. 

After kindly asking us:
- "Hey guys! So, how did it go?"
- We were so proud to annonce him that we did it in 1h44! Seing how proud we were, he told us:
- "Ah... Ok... But please guys, next time you could at least push it a little bit..."

Chamomile and I were both like:
- WHAT!!!???

This is when we saw a little smile on his face and we all burst into laughs.

**Barbie Girl** and **Rambo Chérie** crossed the finish line few minutes after that. **Rambo Chérie** also managed to get a new half-marathon PR and her first race medal!

#### Totally worth it
This race was crazy. Everything started so bad or, better said, so !?&∞&¡¿, but, somehow everything turned up really good! 

Next, the UTMC!
