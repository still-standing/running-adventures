### A doubtful analogy

My first weeks of running could actually be resumed by a simple analogy: It is like **making love to a bear**... (figuratively speaking). 

Figuratively speaking, yes. But the side effects look pretty similar:

* **Dizziness**. It is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is dizziness. Obviously... 
	* Similarly, if you do not breath enough while running... You will get really dizzy! 

* **Dehydration**. It is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is dehydration.  Obviously... 
	* Similarly, if you do not drink enough before the run, during the run, or after the run... You will get really dehydrated!
* **Pain Localized in the Lower Part of The Body**. It is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is pain localized in the lower body parts. Obviously...
	*  Similarly, while starting to run, you will stimulate, in a not so gentle way, muscles, tendons, and ligaments localized in the lower part of your body... And they will let you know that they do not like it at all!

* **Scars**. It is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is getting scars. Obviously... 
	*  Well, if you do not lift your feet high enough you will trip, fall down, and smash the ground!  

I know that you all now expect from me to describe the good parts of **making love to a bear**... Unfortunately, it is time to stop the analogy. For obvious reasons...

### A conclusion

It is fun enough to keep to do it ;-)

### Running log
I prefer to warn you, it will not be impressive!

The number in the green circles represent the distance runned in a day (in km ot in miles!). Not very impressive right? But it is actually even better, there will be a lot room for improvement!

### First 10k ever

And I finished my first 5 weeks of running by doing a 10k! I was pretty happy about that! I wanted now to share this crazy news to my friends in France, and, precisely, I was going to visit them 2 weeks later. I was looking forward to it, they were apparently pretty enthusiastic about a restaurant, and most specifically its dessert menu...

Thinking about how the killer baba night turned out... Something went definitively wrong! I just wanted to brag a bit about running a 10k in less than 1h (at a pace of 5:34min/km)... And now I signed up for a half-marathon (21.1km) with guys running it in less that 5min/km... 

Really?!

### Comments

* I actually heard the **bear expression** quite recently in a business related discussion... Maybe you wonder now what type of job I am doing... Good question! 

* For people still using the imperial unit system: 1mile ~ 1.61km.

* This post will now be referred to as the **bear beginning**.
