### A message of hope 

I perceived my first 10km as **a message of hope** towards greater things in general,
 and longer distances in particular. But, somehow, I misread the message, it was more like: 
 
<br>

<br>

Sadly, pain was the main outcome of my next week of training, and my theory of being unstoppable was kind of wrong...
<br>To be more specific, never a theory was that wrong...
<br>Except maybe the [*String Theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory), but it is kind of different, 
the *String Theory* is [not even wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong)... 
But let's forget of the *String Theory* for now.

### The practice

My first 10k ever was on July the 22nd, and it took me about two months to reach painfully 15km.
Fun fact, I finally managed to get to 15km on a trail in [Page, Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page,_Arizona) at about 1250m above the sea level. 
And I have to admit that it was a lot of fun! Yes the pace was slow, but the landscape was gorgeous!

And, on week after, I got my first half-marathon run in [Palo Alto, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California), but this time, at sea level.

You may notice that I started way to strong, and I actually finished the run walking... 
But again, the good thing is that there is definitely room for improvement!

### When **Bergamot** drops a bomb

In October 2018, **Bergamot** was in need of strong sensations. 
And to fill his need, he decided to run. But not a regular run, he went for the **crazy 8**:

* 24km of distance

<img src="../../images/crazy8-map.jpg" alt="">

* 860m of ascent

<img src="../../images/crazy8-deniv.jpg" alt="">

The reaction what two-fold:

1- The first flow of reactions were very supportive:
    
   * Congratulations **Bergamot**!!!!
   * Is it really impressive!!!! 

2- The second flow of reactions were a little bit more rough:
   * ARE YOU CRAZY!!!! 
   * WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!!!!

At this moment, he innocently tells the Dream Team: 

<br> "A little trail of 30km, 40km in the mountain is kind of tempting, don't you think?"

### The explosion

This comment was followed by silence.

   * **Bergamot** napped.
   * **Chamomile** made some tea to forget this madness.
   * **Barby Girl** drunk *few* cosmopolitan cocktails to calm down.
   * **Aurélia** engraved her shopping list a marble plate. She is born is BC remember?
   * **Rambo Chérie** went ball-trapping to find harmony.
   * and the **Muffin Man** looked for trail races...
 
And the bomb exploded:
<br> Guys, I found a pretty cool trail! 
<br> It is *just* a half-marathon with a teeny-tiny of ascent... 1100m, the [UTMC](https://www.utmc.fr). 
<br> I already registered! You are also coming right?!
<br> And, after napping, drinking tea, engraving shopping list in marble, and ball trapping, the Dream Team signed up for this!!!
