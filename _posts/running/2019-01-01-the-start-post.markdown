### The decor

The moment where everything really started was in Summer 2018 during a dinner at the terrace of a restaurant in 
Nice - South of France, at the terrace of a restaurant in the *Vieux Nice*; 
with a lot of good food, a lot of good wine, one bad cigarette, and with a few good friends, 
or better said, a Dream Team.  
 


### The Dream Team

To respect the privacy and integrity of the people involved in those running adventures, aliases will be used.
Please note that, since we are now in the **Post Gender Theory Era**, 
the biological gender cannot be deduced from the alias... 
So, without further ado, let me briefly introduce the Dream Team:  


#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelia_Cotta"  target="_blank"> <img src="../../images/aurelia.jpg" >  Aurelia </a>
<br>
Born in BC, **Aurélia** is known and respected in 
the Dream Team for both her colossal knowledge and her infinite kindness.  

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_Girl"  target="_blank"><img src="../../images/barbie_girl.jpg" >  Barbie Girl</a>
<br>
After being part of the Danish-Norwegian dance-pop group Aqua, 
**Barbie Girl** left the North of Europe to dedicate her life to her two passions: 
fashion and rugby.

####  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamomile"  target="_blank"><img src="../../images/chamomile.jpg" > Chamomile</a>
<br>
While **Chamomile** is not as kind as **Aurélia**, but no one could be as kind as **Aurélia**, 
**Chamomile** has the gift of bringing calm and happiness in the Dream Team.

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamot_orange"  target="_blank"><img src="../../images/bergamot.jpg" >  Bergamot</a>
<br>
**Bergamot** is able to find the perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness to keep, somehow, things interesting. Interesting enough to be the best man of my wedding.

<br>

Wait, this alias is a little bit too explicit... So let us change it a bit:  

#### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rambo"  target="_blank"> <img src="../../images/rambo.jpg"> Rambo Chérie</a>

Much better!

Now that the introductions are done, let us go back to this dinner and, 
more specifically, the break before the dessert.

### An innocent phrase

We were finishing our glasses of wine while waiting for the dessert. 
The dessert will reveal to be a huge 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_baba"  target="_blank">rum baba</a>, 
with more rum than baba, and which will kill us all later 
(figuratively speaking, of course...).


Waiting for the soon to be killer Baba, I told the table: 

"By the way guys, **Rambo Chérie** and I started to run a bit...".

**Barbie Girl** immediately jumped on me (figuratively speaking , of course...):

- "Next May there is the half-marathon of Nice! I will register! Do you want to register? Better if I register you! Wait we cannot register now... But as soon that we can we register! Deal?"

Rare are the moments where I do not want to speak, this moment was one of those... Having nothing to say, I decided to light a cigarette and wait for the storm to pass... But it did not. 

### The storm

Between my first and second drag, I discovered that:

* **Bergamot** already run the half of Nice under 1h45!

* **Chamomile**  already run the Toulouse half-marathon under 1h35!

* **Barbie Girl** runs few half-marathons and marathons every year, "for fun"!

* **Aurelia** runs the marathon under 3h, "easy"!

### The trap 

OK guys, few comments:

* First, we all need to calm down.

* Second, we should clearly speak a little bit more because I had no clue you were doing all that shit...

* Third, okay guys... Challenge accepted! 

With so much peer pressure, I just had no escape...

After that, the killer Baba arrived, and the rest is just fun blurry history.

### Conclusion

And this is simply how it really started, during a dinner with friends, between the main and the dessert...
