After running two half-marathons races and having registered for a trail and a full marathon, 
a proper training plan was somehow required. Why having a training plan? Simply to run **smart**. 

Their is a lot of information on the web and in the bookshops... But, after doing some filtering,
I ended up with with 5 YouTube videos be watched, few YouTube channels to follow for fun, and two books.
It is of course a very personal choice and I am sure that missed a lot of good stuff.
  
### 4 types of training 
In these for YouTube videos, [Jack Daniels PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)), explains the different types of training. 
I know what you think, but no, the man speaking in these videos is not involved the distillation of whisky.

1- Easy Run

For example, to prepare for a 1h45 half-marathon, the recommended paces for the different types of training are:

### Closing the loop

While the Jack Daniels's videos are, in principle, enough. I found the following one-hour long video very useful too:
