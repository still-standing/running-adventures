After running two half-marathon races and having registered for a trail and a full marathon, 
a proper training plan was, somehow, required. Why having a training plan? Simply to run **smart**. 

There is a lot of information on the web and in the bookshops... But, after doing some filtering,
I ended up with with 5 YouTube videos to be watched, few YouTube channels to follow for fun, and two books.
It is of course a very personal choice and I am sure that I missed a lot of good stuff.
  
### 4 types of training 
In these four YouTube videos, [Jack Daniels PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)), two-time Olympics medalist in modern pentathlon and named "The World's Best Coach" by [Runner's World magazine](https://www.runnersworld.com), 
explains the different types of training. 

I know what you think, but no, the man speaking in these videos is not involved in the distillation of whisky.

1- Easy Run

4- Repetition Training

You may then ask how to find the the paces associated to each type of training. 
The good news is that Jack Daniels takes care of that too!

### About the pace

For example, to prepare for a 1h45 half-marathon, the recommended paces for the each types of training are:

#### A little note, on the paces. 
From the suggested paces graph, you could note that there is a **"no man's land" pace zone** between the easy run pace 5:09min/km and the threshold pace 4:51min/km.
In other words, we should not run in this zone. The bad news is that I was essentially running in the **"no man's land" pace zone** at about 5:30min/km, 
but the good news is that, now, I know I should not!     

### No pain No gain

The Jack Daniels's videos are actually enough. But I also found the following one-hour long video very useful too. 
Especially the session dedicated to the easy run training.

### A little bit of reading

Jack Daniels... again! Plus a book dedicated to marathon training will be enough for me!
