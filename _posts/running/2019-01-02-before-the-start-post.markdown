### A doubtful analogy

My first weeks of running could actually be resumed by a simple analogy: It is like **making love to a bear**... (figuratively speaking). 

Figuratively speaking, for sure. But, somehow, the side effects look surprisingly similar:

* **Dizziness**. It is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is dizziness... 
    Pretty obvious right?...
	* And actually, if you do not breath enough while running - which, trust me, will happen - you will get really dizzy! 
* **Dehydration**. It is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is dehydration...
    Pretty obvious right?... 
	* And actually, if you do not drink enough before the run, during the run, or after the run - which, trust me, will happen - You will get really dehydrated!
* **Pain Localized in the Lower Part of The Body**. It is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is pain localized in the lower body parts...
    Pretty obvious right?... 
	*  And actually, while starting to run, you will stimulate, in a not so gentle way, muscles, tendons, and ligaments localized in the lower part of your body... 
	And they will let you know that they do not like it at all! Which, trust me, will happen.
* **Scars**. It is indeed not so hard to imagine that one of the **making love to a bear** effects is getting scars...
    Pretty obvious right?... 
	*  And actually, if you do not lift your feet high enough you will trip, fall down, and smash the ground! Which, trust me, will happen. 

### A conclusion

You may then ask, why not just stopping?  

Good question! Well, first, the **making love to a bear** side effects disappear, and,
second, it is really fun!

### Running log
I prefer to warn you, it will not be impressive!

The number in the green circles represent the distance runned in a day (in km not in miles!). 
Not very impressive right? But it is actually okay, there will be a lot room for improvement!

### First 10k ever

And I finished my first 5 weeks of running by doing a 10k! 


<img src="../../images/first10k.jpg" alt="">

I was pretty happy about that! I wanted now to share this crazy news with my friends in France. 
And, precisely, I was going to visit them 2 weeks later. 
I was looking forward to it, they were apparently pretty enthusiastic about a restaurant, 
and most specifically its dessert menu...

Thinking about how the  [Killer BaBa Night]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-01-the-start-post %}) 
 turned out... Something went definitively wrong! 
I just wanted to brag a bit about running my first 10k in less than 1h,
 which is, indeed, not that impressive... 
And now I signed up for a half-marathon (21.1km) with guys running it in less that 1h45... 

Really?!

### Comments

* I actually heard the **bear expression** quite recently in a business related discussion... 
Maybe you wonder now what type of job I am doing... Good question! 

* For people still using the imperial unit system (just in case): 1mile ~ 1.61km.

* This post will now be referred to as the **Bear Beginning**.
